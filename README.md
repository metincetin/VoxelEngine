# VoxelEngine
Voxel engine for Unity

Made in Unity 2022.3.12f1, not tested but might work for Unity 2019.3+

What this can do:
- Generating chunk meshes with visible faces only
- Block placement and destruction (raycasting)
- Basic terrain shaping with open simplex noise
- Texturing the blocks (for top and side faces only)

To do:
- Not using MeshCollider for collision
- Dynamic chunk loading/unloading
- Vegetation
- Transparent blocks
- More control over texturing the blocks
